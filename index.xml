Back in time, I’ve created a shell script to deploy a lot of CoreOS servers to my VMware Player, but I hadn’t touched that script since that time.
With the deprecation of CoreOS and the glorious rise of Flatcar Linux to save us, and while needing to test some stuffs in Calico, it came to my mind ‘why not write how to quick deploy a Flatcar Linux VM in VMware Player without scripts?</description></item></channel></rss>

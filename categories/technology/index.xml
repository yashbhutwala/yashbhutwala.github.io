Often, devs, QAs, performance testing teams want to just develop against and test a subset of these microservices. So, instead of spinning up the entire application and all its 100s of containers, it makes sense to only spin up a subset of these services that represent specific &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; functionalities. One way to do this is to represent the dependencies between the services as a graph and use the graph to drive things like minimal deployments.</description></item></channel></rss>

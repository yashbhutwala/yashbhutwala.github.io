## Problem Statement

In a microservices oriented world, applications might be split up over 10s, 100s, 1000s of service containers.  Often, devs, QAs, performance testing teams want to just develop against and test a subset of these microservices.  So, instead of spinning up the entire application and all its 100s of containers, it makes sense to only spin up a subset of these services that represent specific "whole" functionalities.  One way to do this is to represent the dependencies between the services as a graph and use the graph to drive things like minimal deployments.

### Use-cases

- Given a service X, figure out the minimal number of application containers needed
- Deploy things in order, parallel when possible, sequentially when hard dependency, w/ possibility of continuing w/ a soft failure and also short-circuting.
- faster, controlled cloud/production deployments
- performance testing only 1 or N number of services
- devs/QA in the cloud environments

## Solution

[Graphviz](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz) DOT [language](https://graphviz.org/) is a popular layman way of quickly describing graph data in textual form and visualizing it.  One could store the data in a graph database like [neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j) or [dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph), but often dot language is a good least common denominator between devs, qa, devops and non-technical people.  Hence, it makes sense to use the dot file as a "database" and use it to drive multiple downstream consumers based on the ability to query it.

However, once you have such a DOT file, how do you query this graph data using classic graph algorithms?  This is the problem `dotcli` intends to solve.

## Examples

- Check out the installation docs [here](https://github.com/yashbhutwala/dotcli#installation).
- Check out the usage docs [here](https://github.com/yashbhutwala/dotcli#usage)

```bash
dotcli src --help

PATH_TO_DOT_FILE="TODO"
NODE_NAME="TODO"
dotcli src $PATH_TO_DOT_FILE $NODE_NAME
```
